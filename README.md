5. Add a quick reflection(2 sentences) about what was difficult: Overall the project was pretty fn but looking back I struggled a bit to code the colour changing cookies. And at the end after 20 clicks I thought it would be fun if a cute grandma popped up holding cookies to signify the end of the game. But I eventually had to delete this because I couldnt figure out how to make the image reappear.
